     * A "do" loop is used as it executes the code in the loop first
     * and then checks for the loop statement, which is exactly
     * what we need since the used is used to restart the program.
     * The first think done in the loop is to call the "chooseMadlib"
     * variable and saves it to an int. That is followed by an if statement, 
     * depending on the value of the int value created from the "chooseMadlib"
     * method, it either calls on the "doMadlib1" or the "doMadlib2" method.
     * It then calls on the "restart" method to check if the user wants to play again,
     * if true, than the loop repeats, if not then the program prints out the
     * end message and ends.
